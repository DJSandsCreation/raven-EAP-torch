          <h1><i class="fas fa-feather-alt"></i> The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe <i class="fas fa-feather-alt"></i></h1>

          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, over many a
            quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore. While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
            as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “ Tis some visitor, ” I muttered, “ tapping at my
            chamber door; Only this and nothing more. ” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i> </p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; and each separate dying
            ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow. From my
            books surcease of sorrow; sorrow for the lost Lenore. For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name
            Lenore; Nameless here for evermore. <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me;
            filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before. So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood
            repeating. “ Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door — Some late visitor entreating entrance
            at my chamber door; — This it is and nothing more. ” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer. “ Sir, ” said I, “
            or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
            and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you” here I
            opened wide the door; darkness there and nothing more <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
            doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the
            stillness gave no token, and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “ Lenore ? ” This I
            whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “ Lenore ! ”. Merely this and nothing more. <i
              class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, soon again I
            heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. “ Surely, ” said I, “ surely that is something at my window
            lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore. Let my heart be still a moment and
            this mystery explore; “ Tis the wind and nothing more ! ” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, in there
            stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped
            or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door. Perched upon a bust of Pallas
            just above my chamber door. Perched, and sat, and nothing more. <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling. By the grave and
            stern decorum of the countenance it wore, “ Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou, ” I said, “ art sure
            no craven, ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore. Tell me what thy lordly name is
            on the Night’s Plutonian shore ! ” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Quoth the Raven “ Nevermore. ”</p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, though its
            answer little meaning—little relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being. Ever
            yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door. Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his
            chamber door, <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> With such name as “ Nevermore. ” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only. That one word, as
            if his soul in that one word he did outpour.Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered.
            Till I scarcely more than muttered “ Other friends have flown before. On the morrow he will leave me, as my
            Hopes have flown before. ” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Then the bird said “ Nevermore. ” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,“ Doubtless, ” said
            I, “ what it utters is its only stock and store. Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful till his
            songs one burden bore. Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore .. <i
              class="fas fa-crow"></i> </p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Of ‘ Never—nevermore ’. ”</p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling. Straight I wheeled a
            cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to
            linking. Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore. What this grim, ungainly, ghastly,
            gaunt, and ominous bird of yore <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Meant in croaking “ Nevermore. ” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing.To the fowl whose
            fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining. On
            the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er, But whose velvet-violet lining with the
            lamp-light gloating o’er, <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> She shall press, ah, nevermore! <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer. Swung by
            Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these
            angels he hath sent thee. Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;Quaff, oh quaff this kind
            nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p> <i class="fas fa-crow"></i> “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil! Whether
            Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore. Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land
            enchanted. On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore. Is there, is there balm in Gilead?—tell
            me—tell me, I implore!” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!By that
            Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore. Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the
            distant Aidenn,It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore. Clasp a rare and radiant maiden
            whom the angels name Lenore.” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting. “Get
            thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy
            soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my
            heart, and take thy form from off my door!” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting. On the
            pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is
            dreaming, And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that
            shadow that lies floating on the floor <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
          <p><i class="fas fa-crow"></i> Shall be lifted—nevermore! <i class="fas fa-crow"></i></p>
